<h1 id="submit-your-own-message-on-say-something-">Submit your own message on Say Something!</h1>
<p>To submit your own message, you&#39;ll have to contribute to the Say Something repository on Github.</p>
<p>So, essentially you&#39;re contributing to open source! üéâ</p>
<p>Happy Hacktoberfest!</p>
<h2 id="step-1-create-a-github-account">Step 1: Create a Github account</h2>
<p>If you don&#39;t have a Github account already, now&#39;s your chance! Go to the <a href="https://github.com/signup">Github signup page</a> to begin! Should only take a couple of minutes!</p>
<h2 id="step-2-copy-the-project-code-on-your-profile">Step 2: Copy the project code on your profile</h2>
<p>In order to make changes to someone&#39;s piece of code, you have to first create a copy of the code and put it on your own account. </p>
<p>This new copy of the code is what we call a <em>fork</em>. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s how you can create your own fork of the Say Something code:</p>
<p>First, go to the code of the Say Something project.</p>
<p><img src="/write-page-assets/repo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, on the top right of the page you&#39;ll see a link labelled &quot;Fork&quot; with a number next to it. Click on it.</p>
<p><img src="/write-page-assets/fork-button.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You&#39;ll then be taken to a page titled <em>Create a new fork</em>. No need to change anything, just click the green <em>Create fork</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="/write-page-assets/create-fork-page.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You now have a copy of the Say Something code in your profile. You&#39;ll see your profile picture and next to it, the name of your repository: <code>say-something</code>. Under that, you&#39;ll see &quot;forked from SavvasStephanides/say-something&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="/write-page-assets/forked-repo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You&#39;re good to go!</p>
<h2 id="step-3-create-a-file-with-your-message">Step 3: Create a file with your message</h2>
<p>Next step is to add your message to the code!</p>
<p>Now you need to make a decision:</p>
<p>Do you want to use the web interface or the Terminal?</p>
<p>The web interface is much easier because it&#39;s more visual, but if you&#39;re up to the challenge, you can go with the Terminal (or command prompt)!</p>
<details>
    <summary>Web interface</summary>

<p>On your repository, click on the &quot;app&quot; folder, and then &quot;messages&quot;.</p>
<p>Then on the top right, click the &quot;Add file&quot; button. Click &quot;Create new file&quot; from the drop down menu.</p>
<img src="/write-page-assets/create-new-file-menu.png" alt="">

<p>On the next screen, you can now add your message. At the top &quot;Name your file&quot; box, enter an ID for your message, for example <code>just-saying-hello</code>. The ID must be unique from the other files in the &quot;messages&quot; folder.</p>
<p>In the big edit box below, enter your name followed by your message, in this format:</p>
<p><code>By: &lt;your name&gt;
&lt;Your message&gt;</code></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>By: John Doe</p>
<p>Just dropping by to say hello!</code></p>
<img src="/write-page-assets/message-input.png" alt="">

<p>Once you&#39;re done, click the green <em>Commit changes</em> button.</p>
<img src="/write-page-assets/commit-button.png" alt="">

<p>On the pop up dialog that appears, you can change the commit message, or you can leave it as is. You can also add a description. Make sure <em>Commit directly to the main branch</em> is selected, and click the green <em>Commit changes</em> button.</p>
<img src="/write-page-assets/commit-changes-dialog.png" alt="">

<p>You&#39;ll now see the <em>messages</em> folder which now has your new message!</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Terminal</summary>

<p>To use the terminal, you first need to install Git on your computer. You can <a href="https://git-scm.com/">download Git from its website</a>.</p>
<p>Next, you&#39;ll need to download the code you&#39;ve just copied to your computer.</p>
<p>Go to the page of your copied repository and click the green <em>Code</em> button. From the dropdown, you&#39;ll see a URL with a <em>copy</em> icon on the right. Click on that icon which will copy the URL to your clipboard.</p>
<p>Now, open your terminal.</p>
<p>In your terminal, choose a location and enter this command:</p>
<p><code>git clone &lt;URL you just copied&gt;</code></p>
<p>After a few seconds, you&#39;ll have all the code in your computer. Now you can make changes!</p>
<p>Go to the downloaded repository and then go to the <code>app/messages</code> folder:</p>
<p><code>cd say-something
cd apps/messages</code></p>
<p>Here you will create a file with your message. Create a new file on this folder, however way you like. Give a name for your file which will be the ID for your message. Something like <code>just-saying-hello</code>. Make sure it&#39;s unique from the other files in the folder.</p>
<p>Inside the file, write your name and message in this format:</p>
<p><code>By: &lt;your name&gt;
&lt;Your message&gt;</code></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>By: John Doe</p>
<p>Just dropping by to say hello!</code></p>
<p>Once you&#39;re done, go back to the <code>say-something</code> root directory:</p>
<p><code>cd ../..</code></p>
<p>Now for the last 3 steps: put our changed file to a stage, tell Git that it&#39;s safe to push the changes and then push them to your repository.</p>
<p>Firstly, we&#39;re going to &quot;stage&quot; our file. Think of it like putting the file in a box with a tag that says &quot;please put these files in my code&quot;.</p>
<p>To do this, we&#39;re going to use the <code>git add</code> command:</p>
<p><code>git add -A</code></p>
<p>Next, we&#39;re going to say &quot;definitely push these changes&quot;, or as we say, we&#39;re going to &quot;commit our files&quot;. Think of it like putting a lid on the box because we&#39;re sure we want to put our changed files in our code. To do this, we&#39;re using the <code>git commit</code> command:</p>
<p><code>git commit -m &quot;My message&quot;</code></p>
<p>(<code>-m</code> basically means &quot;what I write next is a message)</p>
<p>Finally, we&#39;re going to actually &quot;push&quot; our changes to our code on Github. To do this, we&#39;re going to use the <code>git push</code> command:</p>
<p><code>git push</code></p>
<p>Depending on your system, it will ask you to add your Github credentials. Enter your username and for your password, paste a token that you can create in <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">your token settings</a>.</p>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Don&#39;t enter your Github password in the password field. Generate a token and use that instead!</p>
<p>After a few seconds, your changes should show up on your copy of the Say Something code!</p>

<p>Lastly, we need to add your message to the main website, for the world to see! üëÄ</p>
<h2 id="step-4-ask-for-your-changes-to-be-put-on-the-main-repository">Step 4: Ask for your changes to be put on the main repository</h2>
<p>To ask for your changed file (and message) to be put on the main codebase and therefore the main website, you&#39;ll need to create what is called a <em>pull request</em>.</p>
<p>To do this, go to your repository&#39;s page on Github and click the <em>Pull requests</em> tab at the top:</p>
<p><img src="/write-page-assets/pull-request-tab-link.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the <em>Pull requests</em> page, you&#39;ll see a green &quot;New pull request&quot; button.</p>
<p><img src="/write-page-assets/new-pull-request-button.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Click the button and you&#39;ll be taken to the <em>Comparing changes</em> page.</p>
<p>This page essentially compares your repository with the main repository you copied from at the beginning. </p>
<p><img src="/write-page-assets/file-changes.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Showing 1 changed file with 3 additions and 0 deletions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically this means that there&#39;s 1 file that has changed (or created) with 3 lines added.</p>
<p>Now that you&#39;ve seen your changes, click the green <em>Create pull request</em> button at the top right.</p>
<p><img src="/write-page-assets/create-pull-request-button.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, click the <em>Create pull request</em> button.</p>
<p>You have now successfully created a <em>pull request</em>! In other words, you have created a <em>request</em> for your message to show up on the main Say Something site!</p>
<p><img src="/write-page-assets/pull-request.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now you have to wait for a bit for the request to be approved, and once that&#39;s done, your message will show up on the website! üéâüéâüéâüéâ</p>
<p><img src="/write-page-assets/message.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That&#39;s it! You&#39;ve contributed to open source and you&#39;re message can be read by the whole world! </p>
<p>Well done! üëèüëèüëèüëè</p>
